# NVIDIA-Stocks-Data-2025-predictions-using-ML-and-LSTM
This project leverages NVIDIA's 2025 stock data to build an interactive Streamlit GUI. It preprocesses and visualizes the data, uses an LSTM model to forecast closing prices, and displays actual vs. predicted values along with performance metricsâ€”all in a user-friendly interface for time series analysis.
